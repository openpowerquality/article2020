\section{Introduction}

%{\em The introduction should briefly place the study in a broad context and highlight why it is important. It should define the purpose of the work and its significance. The current state of the research field should be reviewed carefully and key publications cited. Please highlight controversial and diverging hypotheses when necessary. Finally, briefly mention the main aim of the work and highlight the principal conclusions.}

\subsection{Motivation}

Power quality is not currently a concern for most people in developed nations. Just like most people in developed nations assume that their tap water is of adequate quality to drink, most also assume that their electricity is of adequate quality to power their homes and appliances without causing harm. And, in both cases, most people assume that public utilities will appropriately monitor and correct any quality problems if they occur.

Successfully maintaining adequate power quality and providing sufficient amounts of it to meet the rising needs of consumers has been a triumph of electrical utilities for over 100 years. In recent times, however, there have been changes to the nature of electrical generation and consumption that make power quality of increasing concern and interest. First, there is a global need to shift to renewable energy sources. Second, traditional top-down grid power quality monitoring may not be well suited to bottom-up, distributed generation associated with renewable energy sources such as roof-top solar. Third, modern consumer electronics place more stringent demands on power quality.  Finally, effective public policy making in this modern context can be aided by public access to power quality data.  Let's look at each of these in a bit more detail.

{\em 1. We need more renewable energy.} Concerns including pollution, environmental degradation, and climate change have produced a global movement away from centralized, fossil-fuel based forms of electrical energy generation and toward distributed, renewable alternatives such as wind and solar. But the economic, environmental, and political advantages of renewable energy comes with significant new technical challenges. Wind and solar are intermittent (for example, solar energy cannot be harvested at night) and unpredictable (for example, wind and solar energy fluctuate based upon cloud cover and wind speed). In addition, renewable energy generation is often distributed throughout the grid (such as in the case of residential rooftop photovoltaic (PV) systems).

One impact of adding renewable energy generation to an electrical grid is that maintaining adequate power quality is much more challenging. This problem is inversely proportional to the size of the electrical grid. For example, each island in the State of Hawaii maintains its own electrical grid, ranging from a 1.8 GW grid for the island of Oahu to a 6 MW grid for the island of Molokai.  (In contrast, the European electrical grid is approximately 600 GW and the U.S. continental grid is over 1000 GW.) For small grids, the unpredictable nature of power generation for distributed, intermittent renewables can quickly create problems for grid stability. In the case of Hawaii, consumer demand for grid-tied rooftop solar exceeded the ability of Hawaiian Electric to manage, resulting first in complex and expensive "interconnection studies" \cite{trabish_solar_2014,anastasi_energy_2009}, and later in the requirement for new installations to include batteries and grid-disconnected operation.

{\em 2. Traditional top-down monitoring is not well-suited to bottom-up energy generation.} For traditional grid architectures where generation is centralized and under the complete control of the utility, it is common to monitor power quality only to the substation level, because it can be assumed that the power quality experienced at the substation is a reasonably accurate proxy for the power quality experienced by the 1,000 or so end-users serviced by the substation. Furthermore, if an end-user experiences a power quality problem not experienced by the substation, then it is mostly likely due to equipment or electrical issues local to that end-user and not a grid-level problem.

These assumptions might not hold in grids with distributed, intermittent generation by end-users, such as is the case with roof top solar. In these cases, the unpredictable nature of generation can lead to local power quality problems that are not experienced by the substation, and that are not due to any single individual, but rather the bottom-up power generation architecture of the grid. \cite{nakafuji_back--basics_2011}

{\em 3. Consumer electronics require higher quality power.} The rise of consumer electronics has raised the bar for what constitutes ``adequate" power quality. Only a few decades ago, computers were a rare presence outside of labs and large institutions. Today, computers are everywhere: embedded in phones, washers, refrigerators, thermostats, and so forth. These electronic devices not only have higher power quality requirements, but some of them actually introduce power quality problems in the form of harmonic distortion. Poor power quality can result in electronic devices failing unpredictably, and/or decreasing their lifespan.

{\em 4. Power quality data should be publicly available.} Electrical utilities are not required to be totally transparent about the quality of power they provide to consumers. For example, in Hawaii, utilities are required to make a "best effort" to provide non-harmful voltage and frequency values, but are only required to publicly report on power outages of more than 3 minutes. There is no requirement for utilities to report potentially harmful levels of voltage, frequency, THD, or transients as long as they do not lead to outages. Indeed, in places like Hawaii, there is not even infrastructure in place to enable utilities to collect that information, even if they were asked to report on it. For more details, see Hawaiian Electric Tariff Rule No. 2 Character of Service and Hawaiian Electric Tariff Rule No. 16 Interruption of Service.

Providing power quality data to address the above issues requires solving several difficult technical problems. First, monitoring below the substation level increases the number of required monitoring devices by two to three orders of magnitude. This has significant implications for the cost of monitoring in terms of the devices, and the sheer amount of low-level power quality data that will be produced. Second, this low-level data must be processed in a manner that does not require inordinate amounts of processing, network bandwidth, or storage. Finally, the data must lead to actionable information.


\subsection{Goals of the Open Power Quality Project}

The goal of the OPQ Project is to provide an unbiased, independent, third party source of actionable power quality data about electrical grids, particularly those with high levels of distributed, intermittent power generation. OPQ accomplishes this through a low-cost sensor network for power quality using custom power quality monitors with real-time, two way communication to a set of cloud-based services. An OPQ sensor network is intended to be useful to consumers who want to better understand the performance of their public utilities, to researchers who wish to design improvements to grid management, and to public policy makers responsible for designing and implementing regulatory frameworks for electrical utilities.

{\em OPQ Box.} First, our power quality monitoring hardware device, called "OPQ Box" can be produced for approximately US\$75. This is from 10 to 100 times less expensive than commercial power quality monitors. This means, for example, that instead of monitoring power quality at the level of individual buildings, OPQ makes it economically feasible to monitor power quality on each floor or even in each room of a building. Similarly, instead of monitoring power quality at the substation level of the grid, OPQ Boxes make it feasible to deploy dozens or hundreds into a community to obtain fine-grained data about the impact of solar or other renewables as directly perceived by the customer.

{\em Cloud native.} Second, our architecture is "cloud native", which means that OPQ Boxes are not designed for "stand alone", autonomous use, unlike current commercially available power quality monitors. Instead, our hardware boxes and cloud-based services perform real-time, two-way communication over the Internet to determine what power quality data must be gathered and analyzed. This creates the ability to control individual OPQ Boxes based upon the global state of all OPQ Boxes in an OPQ sensor network. It means our cloud services can obtain and analyze high fidelity wave form data only when desired, without the prohibitive network overhead of constantly communicating this data from boxes to the cloud. This enables OPQ installations to be simultaneously responsive and scalable.

{\em Extensibility.} Third, all OPQ software subsystems are designed for extensibility and interoperation. Our middleware components (Mauka and Makai) provide a plugin architecture. Our visualization component (View) is built from modular UI elements using React. We are also developing API endpoints for interoperation with other software systems. This means that OPQ is not a monolithic, closed system with a frozen feature set, but rather a design environment for experimentation with advanced classification and analysis of power quality data.

{\em Open Source.} Fourth, our software and hardware designs and implementations are made available using open source licenses. This means that organizations choosing OPQ do not face the business risk of committing resources to a single vendor with proprietary hardware and software. Our goal is to facilitate the creation of a community of researchers and industry practitioners to replicate, extend, and apply the insights gained from the OPQ system.

Finally, while we believe OPQ offers a compelling combination of capabilities, we want to be clear that all designs involve trade-offs. As we will show below, other commercial and research solutions have features not provided by OPQ that may be important depending upon an organization's specific needs. In some cases, OPQ may not be the appropriate choice. In other cases, a hybrid solution consisting of OPQ in combination with other technologies for power monitoring may be most appropriate. Our goal in this paper is to describe OPQ well enough for organizations to make a thoughtful decision about the use of our technology.
