{\bf Comments from Reviewer 1:}

{\em (1) I think this article should be shortened significantly. The first sections are very descriptive. It's more a project report than a scientific article. Only the section on the results (section 8) is more research oriented. Therefore I suggest to rework the article such that there is much more focus on the scientific aspects and results.}

Thank you for your comments.

We shortened the article from 32 pages to 24 pages.

We modified the structure to provide a more traditional scientific orientation: Introduction, Methods, Related Work, Results and Discussion, Conclusions.

We believe these changes provide more focus on scientific aspects and results.
