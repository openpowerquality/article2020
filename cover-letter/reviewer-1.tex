{\bf Comments from Reviewer 1:}

{\em (1) I think this article should be shortened significantly. The first sections are very descriptive. It's more a project report than a scientific article. Only the section on the results (section 8) is more research oriented. Therefore I suggest to rework the article such that there is much more focus on the scientific aspects and results.}

Thank you for your comments.

The article has been shortened from 32 pages to XX pages.

The structure has been modified to provide a more traditional scientific orientation: Introduction, Related Work, Methods, Results and Discussion, Conclusions.
