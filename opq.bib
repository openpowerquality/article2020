	abstract = {Electrical power grid is undergoing a major renovation, to meet the power quality and power availability demands of the 21st century. The new power grid, which is also called as the smart grid, aims to integrate the recent technological advancements in the Information and Communication Technology (ICT) field to the power engineering field. The present smart grid implementations focus on smart meter based utility-to-meter and utility-to-customer communications. Although these features provide significant improvements on the customer management side, in the following decades, grid management will be one of the major ICT-dominant fields. Recently, adoption of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) for the power grid is gaining wide attention from the industry and the academia. Scalar sensor measurements bring valuable insights, however they can provide limited set of information. In the next generation power grid, limited-sensing, Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) based, centrally controlled operational architecture will be replaced with wireless connected, low-cost, multimedia sensors combined with distributed decision-making and acting systems, working in coordination with a supervisory software tool. In this paper, we discuss the potential applications and the challenges of employing wireless multimedia sensor and actor network (WMSAN) for the smart grid.},

In this paper, a smart sensor network is introduced and the most important features are presented in three different scenarios: a residential home, an industrial installation, and a public building. The proposed system demonstrates its capabilities of in situ real-time processing and big-data off-line network processing. The suggested smart meter is based on field programmable gate array (FPGA) technology that allows a reconfigurable architecture, which lets the user to select the proper processing modules according to their application.

	doi = {10.1109/CPRE.2017.8090033},
	abstract = {The Hawaii Electric Light Company has successfully implemented an automated system to collect synchrophasor and intelligent electronic device (IED) oscillographic reports. They are realizing the benefits of analyzing these two data types together. This paper shares power system disturbances from their system. It also discusses the advantages of integrating time-stamped synchrophasor and IED oscillographic reports together in one power system analysis application. Modern IEDs provide high-accuracy, time-stamped power system measurements primarily in two formats-streaming synchrophasors and high-sample-rate oscillographic reports. Although historically these measurement classes have been treated separately, modern technology is bringing them together and enabling new applications. Synchrophasor measurements are a growing part of real-time operations at utilities during power system disturbances. They provide operators and engineers with a window into the present operating condition of the power grid that is not visible with the typical supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) measurement rates. Traditional post-disturbance analysis involves analyzing high- sample-rate oscillographic reports in order to understand the specific details of a disturbance and the IED operation during the disturbance. The advent of synchrophasors has driven the deployment of global timing signals to IEDs. Because of this, oscillographic reports are now time-stamped with the same high- precision timing source as synchrophasors. Combining synchrophasor measurements and IED oscillographic reports during post-disturbance analysis provides a wide-area context for a better understanding of the conditions leading up to and following a disturbance. Furthermore, integrating the collection of time-aligned IED oscillographic report summaries results in a system that automatically collects and displays these reports along with the synchrophasor data. These oscillographic report summaries can help further characterize the detected disturbance by providing IED information, fault location, fault current, and faulted phases to power system operations personnel.},

With the emergence of more, low-cost photovoltaic (PV) systems and consumer self-generation programs, such as net energy metering and feed-in-tariffs, today's utilities are facing a fundamental shift towards a need to get more visibility to customer-sited, distributed generating resources (DG). The Hawaiian utilities are among an emerging set of utilities around the world leading the nation in contending with high levels of renewable penetration on their distribution systems. Hawaiian Electric Utilities are pursuing efforts to gather, evaluate and target (GET) relevant resource datasets in conjunction with time synchronized system data to enable planning, forecasting and operations with high penetration of variable, distributed renewable resources.},

	abstract = {Low voltage distribution networks feature a high degree of load unbalance and the addition of rooftop photovoltaic is driving further unbalances in the network. Single phase consumers are distributed across the phases but even if the consumer distribution was well balanced when the network was constructed changes will occur over time. Distribution transformer losses are increased by unbalanced loadings. The estimation of transformer losses is a necessary part of the routine upgrading and replacement of transformers and the identification of the phase connections of households allows a precise estimation of the phase loadings and total transformer loss. This paper presents a new technique and preliminary test results for a method of automatically identifying the phase of each customer by correlating voltage information from the utility's transformer system with voltage information from customer smart meters. The techniques are novel as they are purely based upon a time series of electrical voltage measurements taken at the household and at the distribution transformer. Experimental results using a combination of electrical power and current of the real smart meter datasets demonstrate the performance of our techniques.},

Maintaining and sustaining an accurate connectivity model is a key challenge for distribution utilities worldwide. This work shows that voltage time series measurements collected from customer smart meters exhibit correlations that are consistent with the hierarchical structure of the distribution network. These correlations may be leveraged to cluster customers based on common ancestry and help verify and correct an existing connectivity model. Additionally, customers may be clustered in combination with voltage data from circuit metering points, spatial data from the geographical information system, and any existing but partially accurate connectivity model to infer customer to transformer and phase connectivity relationships with high accuracy. We report analysis and validation results based on data collected from multiple feeders of a large electric distribution network in North America. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first large scale measurement study of customer voltage data and its use in inferring network connectivity information.},

Although complex event processing (CEP) is a suitable approach for realizing context-aware services on mobile devices in these environments, existing mobile CEP engines do not leverage the full potential of modern mobile hardware/software architectures. In this paper, we present multimodal CEP, a novel approach to process streams of events on-device in user space (user mode), in the operating system (kernel mode), on the Wi-Fi chip (Wi-Fi mode), and/or on a sensor hub (hub mode), providing significant improvements in terms of power consumption and throughput. Multimodal CEP automatically breaks up CEP queries and selects the most adequate execution mode for the involved CEP operators. Filter, aggregation, and correlation operators can be expressed in a high-level language without requiring system-level domain-specific knowledge. Multimodal CEP enables developers to efficiently detect user activities, collect environmental conditions, or interpret operating system and network events. Furthermore, it facilitates novel context-aware services, demonstrated by a use case for gathering and analyzing mobility data by Wi-Fi probe request tracking.},

	abstract = {In a networked world, events are transmitted from multiple distributed sources into CEP systems, where events are related to one another along multiple dimensions, e.g., temporal and spatial, to create complex events. The big data era brought with it an increase in the scale and frequency of event reporting. Internet of Things adds another layer of complexity with multiple, continuously changing event sources, not all of which are perfectly reliable, often suffering from late arrivals. In this work we propose a probabilistic model to deal with the problem of reduced reliability of event arrival time. We use statistical theories to fit the distributions of inter-generation at the source and network delays per event type. Equipped with these distributions we propose a predictive method for determining whether an event belonging to a window has yet to arrive. Given some user-defined tolerance levels (on quality and timeliness), we propose an algorithm for dynamically determining the amount of time a complex event time-window should remain open. Using a thorough empirical analysis, we compare the proposed algorithm against state-of-the-art mechanisms for delayed arrival of events and show the superiority of our proposed method.},

	abstract = {In 5G mobile networks, computing and communication converge into a single concept. This convergence leads to introduction of Mobile Edge Computing, where computing resources are distributed at the edge of mobile network, i.e., in base stations. This approach signiﬁcantly reduces delay for computation of tasks ofﬂoaded from users’ devices to cloud and reduces load of backhaul. However, due to users’ mobility, optimal allocation of the computational resources at the base stations might change over time. The computational resources are allocated in a form of Virtual Machines (VM), which emulate a given computer system. User’s mobility can be solved by VM migration, i.e., transfer of VM from one base station to another. Another option is to ﬁnd a new communication path for exchange of data between the VM and the user. In this paper we propose an algorithm enabling ﬂexible selection of communication path together with VM placement. To handle dynamicity of the system, we exploit prediction of users’ movement. The prediction is used for dynamic VM placement and to ﬁnd the most suitable communication path according to expected users’ movement. Comparing to state of the art approaches, the proposal leads to reduction of the task ofﬂoading delay between 10\% and 66\% while energy consumed by user’s equipment is kept at similar level. The proposed algorithm also enables higher arrival rate of the ofﬂoading requirements.},

	abstract = {To fully exploit the capabilities of sensors in real life, especially cameras, smart camera surveillance requires the cooperation from both domain experts in computer vision and systems. Existing alert-based smart surveillance is only capable of tracking a limited number of suspicious objects, while in most real-life applications, we often do not know the perpetrator ahead of time for tracking their activities in advance. In this work, we propose a radically different approach to smart surveillance for vehicle tracking. Specifically, we explore a smart camera surveillance system aimed at tracking all vehicles in real time. The insight is not to store the raw videos, but to store the space-time trajectories of the vehicles. Since vehicle tracking is a continuous and geo-distributed task, we assume a geo-distributed Fog computing infrastructure as the execution platform for our system. To bound the storage space for storing the trajectories on each Fog node (serving the computational needs of a camera), we focus on the activities of vehicles in the vicinity of a given camera in a specific geographic region instead of the time dimension, and the fact that every vehicle has a “finite” lifetime. To bound the computational and network communication requirements for detection, re-identification, and inter-node communication, we propose novel techniques, namely, forward and backward propagation that reduces the latency for the operations and the communication overhead. STTR is a system for smart surveillance that we have built embodying these ideas. For evaluation, we develop a toolkit upon SUMO to emulate camera detections from traffic flow and adopt MaxiNet to emulate the fog computing infrastructure on Microsoft Azure.},

	abstract = {In many environmental monitoring applications, since the data periodically sensed by wireless sensor networks usually are of high temporal redundancy, prediction-based data aggregation is an important approach for reducing redundant data communications and saving sensor nodes’ energy. In this paper, a novel prediction-based data collection protocol is proposed, in which a double-queue mechanism is designed to synchronize the prediction data series of the sensor node and the sink node, and therefore, the cumulative error of continuous predictions is reduced. Based on this protocol, three prediction-based data aggregation approaches are proposed: Grey-Model-based Data Aggregation (GMDA), Kalman-Filterbased Data Aggregation (KFDA) and Combined Grey model and Kalman Filter Data Aggregation (CoGKDA). By integrating the merit of grey model in quick modeling with the advantage of Kalman Filter in processing data series noise, CoGKDA presents high prediction accuracy, low communication overhead, and relative low computational complexity. Experiments are carried out based on a real data set of a temperature and humidity monitoring application in a granary. The results show that the proposed approaches signiﬁcantly reduce communication redundancy and evidently improve the lifetime of wireless sensor networks.},

The cumulative computational power of their IT devices, which can be leveraged to continuously monitor the state of the grid, is nonetheless vastly underused. This paper provides evidence of the potential of streaming analysis run at smart grid devices. We propose a structural component, which we name LoCoVolt (Local Comparison of Voltages), that is able to detect in a distributed fashion malfunctioning smart meters, which report erroneous information about the power quality. This is achieved by comparing the voltage readings of meters that, because of their proximity in the network, are expected to report readings following similar trends. Having this information can allow utilities to react promptly and thus increase timeliness, quality and safety of their services to society and, implicitly, their business value. As we show, based on our implementation on Apache Flink and the evaluation conducted with resource-constrained hardware (i.e., with capacity similar to that of hardware in smart grids) and data from a real-world network, the streaming paradigm can deliver efficient and effective monitoring tools and thus achieve the desired goals with almost no additional computational cost.},

	abstract = {With the increasingly widespread collection and processing of “big data,” there is natural interest in using these data assets to improve decision making. One of the best understood ways to use data to improve decision making is via predictive analytics. An important, open question is: to what extent do larger data actually lead to better predictive models? In this article we empirically demonstrate that when predictive models are built from sparse, fine-grained data—such as data on low-level human behavior—we continue to see marginal increases in predictive performance even to very large scale. The empirical results are based on data drawn from nine different predictive modeling applications, from book reviews to banking transactions. This study provides a clear illustration that larger data indeed can be more valuable assets for predictive analytics. This implies that institutions with larger data assets—plus the skill to take advantage of them—potentially can obtain substantial competitive advantage over institutions without such access or skill. Moreover, the results suggest that it is worthwhile for companies with access to such fine-grained data, in the context of a key predictive task, to gather both more data instances and more possible data features. As an additional contribution, we introduce an implementation of the multivariate Bernoulli Naïve Bayes algorithm that can scale to massive, sparse data.},

Unfortunately, this assumption does not hold in a number of practical applications, where sensors may consume even more energy than the radio. In this context, effective energy management should include policies for an efﬁcient utilization of the sensors, which become one of the main components that affect the network lifetime. In this paper, we propose an adaptive sampling algorithm that estimates online the optimal sampling frequencies for sensors. This approach, which requires the design of adaptive measurement systems, minimizes the energy consumption of the sensors and, incidentally, that of the radio while maintaining a very high accuracy of collected data. As a case study, we considered a sensor for snow-monitoring applications. Simulation experiments have shown that the suggested adaptive algorithm can reduce the number of acquired samples up to 79\% with respect to a traditional ﬁxed-rate approach. We have also found that it can perform similar to a ﬁxed-rate scheme where the sampling frequency is known in advance.},

	title = {Analysis and design of power acceptability curves for industrial loads},
	url = {https://drive.google.com/open?id=1UuFF8CHaQDhfq7TQeldFmZNcrwmUp6Ly},
	abstract = {There  has  been  a  concern  in  recent  years  for  electric  power  utilities  to  satisfy  the  increasingly expectations of not only the industrial and commercial, but also the residential users with  respect  to  the  quality  of  the  supplied  energy.  This  concern  calls  for  the  redesigning  of  the  existing  power  quality  indices  to  capture  all  the  industrial,  commercial  and  household  loads,  which  hitherto  has  not  been  considered.  Several  electric  power  indices  have  evolved  over  the  years  as  tools  to  represent,  quantify  and  measure  a  complex  issue  at  hand.  The  use  of  these  indices is widespread in the field of electric power generation, transmission and distribution.  Another way of quantifying power quality issues is the use of power acceptability curves. These curves are plots of bus voltage deviation versus time duration. And they separate the bus voltage  deviation  -  time  duration  plane  into  two  regions:  an  "acceptable"  and  "unacceptable".  Various power acceptability curves exist but the most widely publicized one, which could stand the  test  of  time  and  could  be  relied  on,  is  the  Computer  Business  Equipment  Manufacturers  Association  or  CBEMA  curve.  The  CBEMA  curve  has  been  in  existence  since  1970’s.  Its  primarily  intent  was  to  give  a  measure  of  the  vulnerability  of  mainframe  computer  to  the  disturbance  in  the  electric  power  supply.  But  the  curve  has  been  used  as  a  measure  of  power  quality indices for electric drives and solid-state loads.  In   this   report,   the   concept   of   {\textbackslash}'standards{\textbackslash}'   is   introduced   for   the   design   of   power   acceptability  curves.  The  power  acceptability  curves  are  aides  in  the  determination  of  whether  the  supply  voltage  to  a  load  is  acceptable  for  the  maintenance  of  a  load  process.    The  construction  of  the  well  known  CBEMA  power  acceptability  curve  is  discussed,  and  issues  of  three phase and rotating loads are discussed. iiiThe  main  conclusion  of  this  work  is  that  power  acceptability  curves  can  be  designed  to  detect compliance or noncompliance of the distribution supply to effect a standard. If the load is a  rectifier  load,  the  standard  is  generally  the  permissible  low  threshold  of  DC  voltage  at  the  rectifier  output.  Other  standards  are  possible  including  a  speed  standard  for  rotating  loads.  The  general  process  of  the  design  of  a  power  acceptability  curve  entails  the  solution  of  a  dynamic  model for the load. The dynamic solution then gives a standard parameter versus time, and this is compared with the ultimate standard (e.g., Vdc = 0.87 per unit). This gives a permissible duration of a voltage sag event. The method is easily extended to the unbalanced three phase case.  It  is  shown  in  the  report  that  the  CBEMA  curve  is  effectively  based  on  a  single  phase  rectifier  load  with  DC  threshold  voltage  of  0.87  per  unit  in  the  undervoltage  region.  A  double  exponential  equation  describing  the  curve  is  developed.  This  provides  a  useful  method  to  consider  the  effect  of  unbalanced  voltage  sags  and  to  develop  CBEMA-like  curves  for  other  types of loads. A scalar index of compliance with a power acceptability curve has been illustrated in this report as well.},

	abstract = {Electric power as a commodity is very different from other products – it is generated far from the point of use, is fed to the grid together with the output of many other generators and arrives at the point of use via several transformers and many kilometers of overhead and possibly underground cabling. Quality check of power is very important. But it has constantly been polluted by both consumers (non-linear loads) and utility companies (due to increased use of semi conductor based power processors). Assuring the quality of delivered power to be good enough for the application at hand calls for measurement and study of power quality at the point of common coupling.

There are various categories of Power Quality issues. Issues related to voltage amplitude variations will include voltage sags/dips and voltage swells. Issue related to frequency is harmonics in the power system. Short term problems include transients and momentary interruptions. We have carried out a brief study of all these PQ issues, and problems caused by them.

Developments in the field of power electronics has brought tremendous power processing capability to engineers but it has also polluted the power system with harmonics. Then there are non linear loads that inject harmonics in the power system. Measurement and estimation of harmonics in power system has become one of the most important tasks in the hands of power system engineers for increasing reliability and quality of supplied power. For harmonic analysis FFT based schemes are unable to give enough information for PQ mitigation. So researchers have been attempting other methods to estimate harmonics in sampled voltage and current signals. Among these; least square estimation, for estimating amplitudes and particle swarm optimization with passive congregation, for estimating phase and frequency used together has most attractive features of compactness and fastness. We have developed a harmonic estimator based on LSE and PSOPC to estimate amplitude, phase and frequency of the sampled signal. We have used the estimator on real time data acquired using a digital storage oscilloscope in Electrical Machines Laboratory of Department of Electrical Engineering at NIT Rourkela. The results for estimating integral harmonics are attractive and encourage researchers to modify the estimator code to make it able to estimate inter-harmonics and sub-harmonics also.},

	url = {http://vuir.vu.edu.au/17910/},
	abstract = {The impact of renewable energy installations connected to the utility grid is an important issue concerning the technical and economic viability of harnessing these emerging energy sources. Distribution networks must be carefully controlled in order to maintain an acceptable power supply quality. The major sources of non-conventional energy are small scale generation and storage from mini hydro, photovoltaic, wind power, fuel cells, battery, flywheel, pump storage and biomass. The aim of this thesis is to analyse the variation in voltage of the distribution network when renewable energy sources are interconnected to the distribution network, in terms of it's stability. In particular this study analyses the impact of interconnection of small synchronous generators to the utility power grid. Dynamic stability analysis is mainly concerned with analysing the response of electrical power system to small perturbation about a given operating point. These studies are particularly important due to the growing interest in interconnecting small renewable energy sources to large and complex power systems. Simulation studies were carried out in order to find out the transient stability and voltage stability of the non-conventional energy sources under different operating conditions. A 5-second simulation was conducted using explicit numerical integration (Euler method) and an integration time step of 0.002 second. Power System Toolbox was used for analysis.The multimachine power system models used in this thesis are generated in MATLAB code. The load flow is performed on the multimachine power system correponding to the loading condition to be investigated. The machines are represented by the two-axis models, the exciters by IEEE Type-1 models and the loads are modelled as constant impedances. To save programming time, it has become common to limit the machine and exciter representations to some specified models. The network admittance matrix is reduced by retaining only the internal buses of the generators. The reduced network, machine and exciter data are then combined to form a linearised state-space model representing the entire system. The simulation studies are applied to a four machine ten bus system. It is clear from the analysis that much care should be taken based on the stability point of view while interconnecting the small renewable energy sources to the utility. The renewable energy sources should be interconnected at a point which provides higher stability margin.The renewable energy sources is a viable option if it is connected to the distribution network with necessary methods of improving transient stability and voltage stability.},

	abstract = {abstract: There has been a considerable growth in distributed photovoltaic (PV) genera-tion and its integration in electric power distribution systems. This has led to a change in the distribution system infrastructure. Properly planned distributed gen-eration can offer a variety of benefits for system operations and enhance opera-tional performance of the distribution system. However, high penetration of PV resources can give rise to operating conditions which do not arise in traditional systems and one of the potential issues that needs to be addressed involves impact on power quality of the system with respect to the spectral distortion in voltages and currents. The test bed feeder model representing a real operational distribution feeder is developed in OpenDSS and the feeder modeling takes into consideration the ob-jective of analysis and frequency of interest. Extensive metering infrastructure and measurements are utilized for validation of the model at harmonic frequencies. The harmonic study performed is divided into two sections: study of impact of non-linear loads on total harmonic voltage and current distortions and study of impact of PV resources on high frequency spectral distortion in voltages and cur-rents. The research work incorporates different harmonic study methodologies such as harmonic and high frequency power flow, and frequency scan study. The general conclusions are presented based on the simulation results and in addition, scope for future work is discussed. Dissertation/Thesis Masters Thesis Electrical Engineering 2014},

When we talk about renewable energy is difficult not to refer to solar photovoltaic technology due to its high rate of growth compared to their peers and potential. This is associated with the fact that the Ecuadorian government is implementing a process of changing the production and country's energy matrix where one of the fundamental pillars is to eliminate dependence on fossil resources and promote the use of renewable energy. Therefore, this makes clear that it is important and needed to study the effects and possible problems that entails the use of photovoltaic systems connected to the network. In this context, this work focuses on power quality by connecting photovoltaic plants to low-power electrical distribution networks. The evaluated system is composed of a group of panels of different technologies connected to a communication unit that forms the connection point of the photovoltaic system and the electric network. Measurement and data acquisition in real time of the implemented system and the respective analysis was made by considering the existing regulations. Finally, a mathematical analysis was performed in order to analyze the impact of the most important variables on power quality.},

The intermittent nature of solar energy generation and the associated power electronic inverters with connected consumer loads creates a number of potential challenges in integrating large-scale PV into the grid that affects power quality of the distribution networks. This paper investigates the impacts of varying PV integration into the grid through experimental and simulation studies. Initially, several experiments were conducted with varying PV penetration and load conditions using the Renewable Energy Integration Facility at CSIRO, Newcastle, Australia. Later, a simulation model was developed that mimics the experimental facility used at CSIRO to investigate the adverse impacts on integrating large-scale PV into the grid using the power system simulation software PSS Sincal. Experimental and simulation analyses clearly indicate that integration of PV into the grid causes power quality issues such as voltage instability, harmonic injection, and low power factor into the networks and the level of these impacts increases with the increase of PV penetration.},

The stochastic nature of PVDG and loads were considered in the study using probabilistic techniques. The impact of PVDG on the number of tap changes of the voltage regulators was investigated. The tests results in a real life large scale distribution network demonstrated that the PVDG can cause around 31\% of improvements in the voltage conformity indices. This impact is less beneficial than the one associated with the connection of conventional distributed generation due to the variability in the primary energy resource. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that the connection of PVDG increases the lifespan of the voltage regulators as a result of a reduction about 20\% in the number of tap changes.},

Parameters such as active and reactive power, voltage, current, power factor, THDv, THDi, individual harmonic voltage and harmonic current are observed for the investigation of the interaction between SERT PV system and distribution network’s power quality. According to the measured data, PV system operation is negligible in terms of voltage distortion, voltage magnitude and frequency variation. Therefore, it can be noticed that 10 kWp SERT PV system does not effect on the distribution system power quality due to low PV penetration level.},

Photovoltaic systems affect the voltage profile and harmonic distortion of current and voltage. Ensuring the appropriate voltage profile is especially important in radial networks because of eventual huge voltage drops. Many photovoltaic systems on a radial network with relatively high short-circuit impedance and relatively low short-circuit power can be problematic with regard to the permitted level of harmonic distortion, particularly at lower power.

Recently, grid connected PV micro-generation facilities in individual homes have increased due to governmental policies as well as greater attention by industry. As low voltage (LV) distribution systems were built to make energy flow in one direction, the power feed-in of PV generation in rural low-voltage grids can influence power quality (PQ) as well as facility operation and reliability. This paper presents results on PQ analysis of a real PV generation facility connected to a rural low-voltage grid. Voltage fluctuations and voltage harmonic contents were observed. Statistical analysis shows a negative impact on PQ produced by this PV facility and also that only a small fraction of the energy available during a sunny day is converted, provoking losses of revenue and forcing the converter to work in an undesirable operating mode. We discuss the disturbances imposed upon the grid and their outcome regarding technical and economic viability of the PV system, as well as possible solutions. A low-voltage grid strengthening has been suggested and implemented. After that a new PQ analysis shows an improvement in the impact upon PQ, making this facility economically viable.},

This paper discusses the generation and propagation of significant current/voltage harmonics which are caused by PV inverters in distribution networks. The impact made by high switching frequencies and different operating scenarios are studied by detailed modelling of PV inverters in a typical low voltage (LV) distribution network using PSCAD/EMTDC simulation platform. It was found that the PV inverter systems inject high frequency current harmonics at the switching frequency or associated side bands. Low order current harmonics are also significant due to the inability of switching control system of PV inverter to produce perfectly sinusoidal output. It is found that the amount of harmonics depend on the inverter control strategy, background distortion present at the point of connection (POC) and the percentage of inverter loading. Further, harmonic voltage distortion is found to be mainly dependent on the impedance of the distribution network where weak networks lead to give rise to higher voltage distortions. Moreover, harmonic resonances are significant due to the interaction of the inverter output impedance and the grid inductance. The current harmonics injected by single phase inverters have been found substantial and influential with regard to the energy transmission and increase losses.},

	abstract = {The rapid growth of variable electricity generation in low-voltage electricity grids poses new challenges to the operation of power systems. Distributed non-dispatchable electricity from renewable sources, such as photovoltaic solar energy, can potentially impact power quality, particularly voltage regulation. In response, inverter manufacturers and recent standards have introduced automatic inverter response functions, such as the commonly known as Volt-Watt and Volt-VAR functions. These functions aim to mitigate under- and over-voltage events by gracefully curtailing injected active power, or injecting/absorbing reactive power when the voltage at the point of coupling exceeds the predefined regulation limits. While the utility of these new inverter functionalities has been established in various studies, the analysis of their stability properties, particularly in the context of persistent changes in load, remains scarce. This paper contributes a framework for nonlinear analysis of voltage stability and boundedness in distribution networks with variable loads. The framework is applied to the case of a single grid-connected inverter to derive sufficient conditions for steady-state voltage boundedness as a function of the load variation levels in the inverter bus. Simulation results illustrate the accuracy of these bounds for varying load conditions.},

As a pilot WAMS that has been operated for more than a decade, the frequency monitoring network FNET/GridEye makes use of hundreds of global positioning system-synchronized phasor measurement sensors to capture the increasingly complicated grid behaviors across the interconnected power systems. In this paper, the FNET/GridEye system is overviewed and its operation experiences in electric power grid wide area monitoring are presented. Particularly, the implementation of a number of data analytics applications will be discussed in details.

	abstract = {Real-time situational awareness tools are of critical importance to power system operators, especially during emergencies. The availability of electric power has become a linchpin of most post-disaster response efforts, because public and private sector services depend upon it. Knowledge of the scope and extent of facilities impacted, as well as the duration of their dependence on backup power, enables emergency response officials to plan for contingencies and provide a better overall response. Based on the measurement data acquired by the frequency disturbance recorders deployed in the North American power grids, an off-grid detection method is proposed and implemented. This method monitors the critical electrical loads and detects the transition of these loads from an on-grid operation to an off-grid operation, during which the loads are fed by an uninterrupted power supply or a backup generation system. The details of the detection algorithm are presented, and some case studies and off-grid detection scenarios are also provided to verify the effectiveness and robustness. This paper also presents the real-time implementation of this method and several effectively detected off-grid situations. Moreover, two visualization tools are developed to display the real-time system operation condition in an intuitive manor.},

OPQ provides real-time distributed power measurements which allows users to see both local PQ events and grid-wide PQ events. The OPQ project has three principal components: back-end hardware for making power measurements, middleware for data acquisition and analysis, and a front-end providing visualizations. OPQBox2 is a hardware platform that takes PQ measurements, provides onboard analysis, and securely transfers data to our middleware. The OPQ middleware performs filtering on the OPQBox2 sensor data and performs high-level PQ analysis. The results of our PQ analysis and real-time state of the sensor network are displayed using OPQView.

	abstract = {A good power quality (PQ) is an important factor for the reliable operation of electrical loads. High penetration of nonlinear loads, such as compact fluorescent lamps, light-emitting diode (LED) lamps, switching mode power suppliers give rise to serious challenges in power quality for distribution systems. Harmonic distortion produced by nonlinear loads causes several problems, ranging from increased power losses in customer equipment, power transformers and power lines, shorter life of organic insulation to malfunction of electronic devices and telecommunication systems.  Last decade power quality issues have become serious concern for commercial and office customers. According to Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) estimates, more than 70\% of all loads are nonlinear.  The IEEE and international standards [1, 2] set the limits for harmonic distortions. However they do not offer any strategy for the detection of distorting sources in the grid.  Information on the location of the distorted sources can be obtained by distributed measurement system abled to perform simultaneous measurements in different nodes of the considered grid.  This paper describes a distributed measurement system for power quality monitoring. The results of PQ measurements are reported.},

Quantifying the cost to the consumer when the supply power quality or reliability are not as expected is an important metric and can be used as business case to justify expenditure in order to improve the supply network. This paper explores the research associated with quantifying the cost of reliability and power quality. Several power quality disturbances are investigated and possible methods of quantifying both the effect and cost are presented. Due to the complex nature of equipment performance with regard to power quality, there is a need for extensive research in order to develop a generalised approach to lifetime and cost evaluation.},

	abstract = {The main goal of this project was to create a software system that analyzed data collected from smart meters and alerted the user of power quality issues. Power quality, for the purposes of this project, will be defined as IEEE Std 1159 states, “a wide variety of electromagnetic phenomena that characterize the voltage and current at a given time and at a given location on the power system.” Power quality metrics are defined by a percentage variance from the nominal value over a period of time. The metrics focused on in this report were limited by the resolution of data collected from the smart meters, which was 16.67 ms. This resolution allowed us to analyze disturbances including voltage sags, voltage swells, and harmonics (these disturbances will be further discussed in the body of the report). Along with these disturbances, we also found intervals in the data where low power factor (PF) was of concern.

During phase one; we researched definitions, causes, and effects of the aforementioned disturbances. From this, we determined that the best approach to classify these issues would be to use the per-unit system and classify them according to parameters set for power quality issues described in IEEE Std 1159. Once enough data was collected, algorithms were written to extract the data from a comma separated value (.csv) file and uploaded into MatLab. Once the data was uploaded into MatLab, techniques such as the fast Fourier transform (FFT) and averaging sliding window were carried out to locate disturbances. The FFT gave us a means to traverse between the time domain and the frequency domain. The averaging sliding window acted as a low pass filter and got rid of noise that would otherwise flag the beginning of a disturbance haphazardly, ultimately slowing down our algorithms. The algorithms were written as functions, tested and compared with known results from other sources, and then added to a graphical user interface (GUI). The GUI was designed to logically allow any user to plot and textually output any power quality issues, found within our resolution limits, for their own inspection.},

	abstract = {PQ issues are very much important for utilities, customers and end users and it is essential to be known by the concerned authorities and users for reduction of economic losses due to the poor PQ. The cost of poor PQ is high and rising. The paper gives insights on global economical losses due to poor PQ. The business risk posed by PQ problems is a real one with even ‘low tech’ industries exposed to serious financial losses. The global economic meltdown is not the only factor that is pulling down the revenues of Asian countries. A study released said Indian industries lost more than \$ 9.6 billion in 2008-09 due to power outages. According to 2008 reports, poor power quality costs European business more than 150 billion dollars a year.

In this paper, a comprehensive survey on different power quality related problems as experienced by customers in different countries are highlighted. Summary of PQ costs are given. As the consequence of poor PQ might have large financial impacts on a country’s economy, more initiatives are expected from the concerned parties and regulating bodies to take corrective measures for maintaining better power quality from utility and at end users. Smart grid requires intelligent PQ monitoring to solve different PQ related problems. Authors proposed an intelligent power quality monitoring system that will help to detect different PQ disturbances and consequently assist in employing or implementing appropriate mitigation techniques.},

Methods such as Fast Fourier transform (FFT) and the Wavelet transform were used to monitor harmonics on the system and to detect short time voltage variations. When a short duration voltage fluctuation or an exceeding in the harmonic limits is noticed, the implemented system records the event time for further analysis. The platform also records all the signal in the time domain continuously without any blank window. The postprocessing is performed using the samples of the recorded signal. The analyzer can choose the amount of pre- and/or post event time, in 60 Hz cycles, to rebuild the event waveform. To validate the platform, it was subjected to tests such as the system voltage variation, momentary interruption, voltage sag and violations in harmonic distortion rates.},

It supports both high-speed analog sampling and digital sampling that means the IED can receive IEC61850-9-2 packets through SV module. The SV and CPU modules exchange real-time data via high-speed LVDS bus on the backplane. The monitoring IED can be installed on any monitoring node as its distributed architecture design.

To overcome this problem the paper proposes a prototypal measurement instrument for PQ monitoring based on field programmable gate arrays, in compliance with IEC 61000-4-30 and IEC 61000-4-7 standards. Features of the proposing instrument are the good accuracy and the cost effectiveness. The realized instrument applies a novel digital filter approach to harmonic and interharmonic estimation. After a detailed description of the proposed instrument, an experimental performance characterization in emulated environment is presented. Results are also compared with those furnished by a FFT approach suggested by IEC61000-4-7 standard confirming the goodness of the proposal.},

	abstract = {One of the most important characteristics of the electric power system is its observability. The observability is essential not only for the power flows and power supply reliability indices, but also for the power quality indicators, particularly for the nonsinusoidality of supply voltage waveform. The wide use of power electronics components in intelligent electric power systems, which will increase in the future, leads to the occurrence of harmonic voltage and currents. Moreover, the electric power system facilities can be represented by both the sources and the consumers of high harmonics []. In this connection the assessment of impact of individual facilities on the power quality is a topical problem. The observability of electric power systems can be provided with the use of phasor measurement units (PMUs). The paper proposes a distributed power quality monitoring system based on the available PMU infrastructure to continuously control the level of high harmonics in different cutsets of the electric power system.},

An expert system is suitable when one has limited amount of data and sufficient power system expert knowledge; however, its application requires a set of threshold values. Statistical methods are suitable when large amount of data is available for training. Two important issues to guarantee the effectiveness of a classifier, data segmentation, and feature extraction are discussed. Segmentation of a sequence of data recording is preprocessing to partition the data into segments each representing a duration containing either an event or a transition between two events. Extraction of features is applied to each segment individually. Some useful features and their effectiveness are then discussed. Some experimental results are included for demonstrating the effectiveness of both systems. Finally, conclusions are given together with the discussion of some future research directions.},

	abstract = {This paper describes countrywide electrical power quality (PQ) assessments of the Turkish Electricity Transmission System through a genuine PQ database. The database stores the output of mobile PQ measurement systems which are established at 172 transformer substations of the transmission system. At 601 measurement points in these substations, which are potentially critical in terms of PQ, measurements are carried out by the mobile systems for a period of 1 week. PQ parameters defined in the IEC-61000- 4-30 standard in addition to power values are calculated from acquired raw data by the mobile-monitoring system and the resulting data are transferred to the PQ database. The database, based on a novel PQ data model, enables its users to take PQ snapshots of the transmission system countrywide and can be accessed through several interfaces including a visual query interface, a natural language interface, and a map interface. The overall PQ status of the measured points, representing the characteristics of the transmission system, is assessed through these interfaces and problematic points are determined while deriving important conclusions about the transmission system’s PQ behavior. Moreover, several novel PQ assessment methods are proposed and their applications on the PQ data are demonstrated especially through the map interface.},

	abstract = {Power Quality assessment is today one of the main ways to improve energy efficiency. International standards tend to restrict the way this assessment is done, by defining the measurements methods that should be adopted by an instrument. This work describes some of the constrictions and requirements assumed for the design of the high performance Power Quality data logger PQ1000, taking into account the international standards IEC 61000-4-30 Class A and the IEC 61000-4-15 published in August 2010. Trough it, the most important demands of the IEC 61000-4-30 class A instruments are exposed. Details of the hardware components are also shown, and the most important points of the signal processing path are explained. The performance in the RMS values determination is given, also the frequency response for harmonics measurement are shown, and a detailed analysis of fulfillment of the tests given in the IEC 61000-4-15 ed. 08-2010 are given in the final section.

This protocol aim is to guarantee a higher degree of compatibility between instruments of different manufacturers and models. The tests here presented intend to submit the equipments to a more real situation, and try to show possible hardware or firmware defects. The results given by the PQ1000 widely surpasses the standards exigencies.},

extensible database architecture is presented based on a novel generic data model for PQ data. The proposed
architecture is operated on the nationwide PQ data of the Turkish Electricity Transmission System
measured in the field by mobile PQ monitoring systems. The architecture is extensible in the sense that it
can be used to store and manage PQ data collected by any means with little or no customization. The
architecture has three modules: a PQ database corresponding to the implementation of the generic data
model, a visual user query interface to enable its users to specify queries to the PQ database and a query
processor acting as a bridge between the query interface and the database. The operation of the architecture
is illustrated on the field PQ data with several query examples through the visual query interface.
The execution of the architecture on this data of considerable volume supports its applicability and convenience
for PQ data.},
